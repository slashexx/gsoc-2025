## About the Project

The project brought the **Prometheus Agent's DaemonSet mode** in *Prometheus Operator* to full production readiness. This involved addressing missing functionalities, improving configuration validation, enhancing reliability, and providing comprehensive documentation. The ultimate goal was to offer a scalable, efficient, and fully supported way to run Prometheus Agent across Kubernetes nodes. This was achieved by integrating remaining features like *using CEL for CRD validation* to provide immediate feedback along with adding *runtime checks* as a fallback for older Kubernetes versions. Furthermore, investigating and potentially implementing *EndpointSlice* for scalability and extending integration tests to multi-node Kind clusters. Finally, adding detailed documentation and example manifests.
